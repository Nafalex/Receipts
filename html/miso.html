            <p>"Easy to make and tasty," according to Brownie5. "Made it for my husband when he wasn't feeling well. Wanted to give him something else instead of the chicken noodle soup he's been drinking. The tofu is a good source of protein to fill his stomach."</p>
            <p>"I was looking to replicate the taste of restaurant miso soup at home," says Earnest Cavalli. "This does the job perfectly. That said, I prefer firm tofu to silky, but that's a personal taste thing. Either works great in this recipe."</p>
